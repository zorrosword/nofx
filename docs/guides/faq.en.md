## General Questions

### What is NOFX?
NOFX is an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading bot that uses large language models (LLMs) to make trading decisions on futures markets.

### Which exchanges are supported?
- ✅ Binance Futures
- ✅ Hyperliquid
- 🚧 More exchanges coming soon

### Is NOFX profitable?
AI trading is **experimental** and **not guaranteed** to be profitable. Always start with small amounts and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

### Can I run multiple traders simultaneously?
Yes! NOFX supports running multiple traders with different configurations, AI models, and trading strategies.

## Setup & Configuration

### What are the system requirements?
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (Docker recommended)
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended
- **Disk**: 1GB for application + logs
- **Network**: Stable internet connection

### Do I need coding experience?
No! NOFX has a web UI for all configuration. However, basic command line knowledge helps with setup and troubleshooting.

### How do I get API keys?
1. **Binance**: Account → API Management → Create API → Enable Futures
2. **Hyperliquid**: Visit [Hyperliquid App](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/) → API Settings

### Should I use a subaccount?
**Recommended**: Yes, use a subaccount dedicated to NOFX for better risk isolation. However, note that some subaccounts have restrictions (e.g., 5x max leverage on Binance).

## Trading Questions

### Why isn't my trader making any trades?
Common reasons:
- AI decided to "wait" due to market conditions
- Insufficient balance or margin
- Position limits reached (default: max 3 positions)
- See detailed diagnostics in [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#-ai-always-says-wait--hold)

### How often does the AI make decisions?
Configurable! Default is every **3-5 minutes**. Too frequent = overtrading, too slow = missed opportunities.

### Can I customize the trading strategy?
Yes! You can:
- Adjust leverage settings
- Modify coin selection pool
- Change decision intervals
- Customize system prompts (advanced)

### What's the maximum number of concurrent positions?
Default: **3 positions**. This is a soft limit defined in the AI prompt, not hard-coded. See `decision/engine.go:266`.

## Technical Issues

### Binance Position Mode Error (code=-4061)

**Error**: `Order's position side does not match user's setting`

**Solution**: Switch to **Hedge Mode** (双向持仓)
1. Login to [Binance Futures](https://www.binance.com/en/futures/BTCUSDT)
2. Click **⚙️ Preferences** (top right)
3. Select **Position Mode** → **Hedge Mode**
4. ⚠️ Close all positions first

**Why**: NOFX uses `PositionSide(LONG/SHORT)` which requires Hedge Mode.

See [Issue #202](https://github.com/tinkle-community/nofx/issues/202) and [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#-only-opening-short-positions-issue-202).

### Backend won't start / Port already in use

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Change port in .env
NOFX_BACKEND_PORT=8081
```

---

### Frontend shows "Loading..." forever

**Quick Check**:
```bash
# Is backend running?
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

If not, check [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#-frontend-cant-connect-to-backend).

---

### Database locked error

**Solution**:
```bash
# Stop all NOFX processes
docker compose down
# OR
pkill nofx

# Restart
docker compose up -d
```

## AI & Model Questions

### Which AI models are supported?
- DeepSeek (recommended for cost/performance)
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Custom models via API

### How much do API calls cost?
Depends on your model and decision frequency:
- **DeepSeek**: ~$0.10-0.50 per day (1 trader, 5min intervals)
- **GPT-4**: ~$2-5 per day
- **Claude**: ~$1-3 per day

### Can I use multiple AI models?
Yes! Each trader can use a different AI model. You can even A/B test different models.

### Does the AI learn from its mistakes?
Yes, to some extent. NOFX provides historical performance feedback in each decision prompt, allowing the AI to adjust its strategy.

## Data & Privacy

### Where is my data stored?
All data is stored **locally** on your machine in SQLite databases:
- `config.db` - Trader configurations
- `trading.db` - Trade history
- `decision_logs/` - AI decision records

### Is my API key secure?
API keys are stored in local databases. Never share your databases or `.env` files. We recommend using API keys with IP whitelist restrictions.

### Can I export my trading history?
Yes! Trading data is in SQLite format. You can query it directly:
```bash
sqlite3 trading.db "SELECT * FROM trades;"
```
